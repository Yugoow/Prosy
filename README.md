<h3>How to use</h3>
Info : The database will be automatically created in your app folder.<br>
At your first launch, you will be asked which blocks you want to work on but because you never launched it there is no blocks showed.<br>
<h5>Add a block</h5>
To add a new block just write a name block that doesn't exist (when you are asked to choose one) and it will be created automaticaly.<br>
With this done, you can interact with your block by various <a href="#actions">actions</a>.<br>


<h3 class="actions">Actions in a block:</h3>
<strong>0 - Simulation</strong> -> Simulation up to 4 notes for the block validation<br>
<strong>1 - Add notes </strong> -> Just adding notes in a block<br>
<strong>2 - Delete notes (not available) </strong> -> Deleting notes, but acutally not available<br>
<strong>3 - See your notes </strong> -> See the notes (and the average) of the block<br>
<strong>4 - Only the average </strong> -> Show only the average of the block<br>
<strong>5 - Rename the block </strong> -> Rename the block<br>
<strong>6 - Choose another block </strong> -> Switching block<br>
<strong>7 - Delete "name_of_the_block" </strong> -> Delete the block (!! the notes are also deleted !!)<br>
<strong>8 - Quit </strong> -> Quit the app<br>
