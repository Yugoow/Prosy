<h2>Special CESI calculator</h2>

<h4>How to use</h4>
Info : The database will be automatically created in your app folder.
At your first launch, you will be asked which blocks you want to work on but because you never launched it there is no blocks showed.
<h7>Add a block</h7>
To add a new block just write a name block who doesn't exist (when you are asked to choose one) and it will be created automaticaly.
With this done, you can interact with your block by various <a href="#actions">actions</a>.


<h4 class="actions">Actions in a block:</h4

0 - Simulation                      -> Simulation up to 4 notes for the block validation
1 - Add notes                       -> Just adding notes in a block
2 - Delete notes (not available)    -> Deleting notes, but acutally not available
3 - See your notes                  -> See the notes (and the average) of the block
4 - Only the average                -> Show only the average of the block
5 - Rename the block                -> Rename the block
6 - Choose another block            -> Switching block
7 - Delete "name_of_the_block"      -> Delete the block (!! the notes are also deleted !!)
8 - Quit                            -> Quit the app
